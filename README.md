#  Welcome

I'm Lokesh, a Final-year B.Tech student majoring in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a minor in Software Engineering at NIT Andhra Pradesh, interested to work in the AI/ML research domain with a strong focus on integrating software development.

I worked with following list until now and trying to expand the list
## Technical Background

- **Languages**: Java, Python  
- **Core Concepts**: Data Structures, Algorithms, OOPs, DBMS, Image Processing
- **AI/ML**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, LLMs  
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: LangChain, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, NLTK, Pandas  
- **Tools/Platforms**: Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, IntelliJ, VS Code, Windows, Linux

## Projects

-  [Detecting Hallucinations in LLMs]  
  Implemented a method, that computes Laplacian matrix from transformer attention, selects top-k eigenvalues, reduce the dimensions with PCA, and feed the reduced feature vector to binary classifier.

-  [Multimodal Neural Networks for E-commerce Product Valuation]()  
  Developed multimodal deep learning pipeline extracting 512 dimensional CLIP embeddings from images and text, concatenating into 1024-dim vectors with statistical features to predict the product price, achieving 46% SMAPE for e-commerce price estimation..

--- and many more..
