## 🚀 Projects

- 🔍 [AI-Powered Research Assistant](https://github.com/rlnlokesh/AI-Powered-Research-Assistant)  
  Built an autonomous research assistant using RAG architecture with LangGraph and Streamlit. It dynamically routes queries between arXiv and Wikipedia, delivering real-time, well-sourced responses.

- 🧠 [Face Recognizer](https://github.com/rlnlokesh/Face-Recogniser)  
  Developed an SVM-based face recognition model using a custom dataset. Applied Haar wavelet transforms and hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV to improve precision.
